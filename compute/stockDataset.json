These probabilities are determined by the health states of the vehicles, which are considered to be random variables distributed by a parameterized family of probability distribution functions. During the operation of the trips, the corresponding parameters get updated. In this article, we present a dual solution approach for RSRP-PdM and generalize a linear programming based lower bound for this problem to families of probability distribution functions with more than one parameter. For this purpose, we define a rounding function that allows for a consistent underestimation of the parameters and model the problem by a state-expanded event-graph in which the possible states are restricted to a discrete set. This induces a flow problem that is solved by an integer linear program. We show that the iterative refinement of the underlying discretization leads to solutions that converge from below to an optimal solution of the original instance. Thus, the linear relaxation of the considered integer linear program results in a lower bound for RSRP-PdM.

In recent years, graph neural networks have achieved remarkable performance in this problem by formulating multiple stocks as graph-structured data. However, most of these approaches rely on artificially defined factors to construct static stock graphs, which fail to capture the intrinsic interdependencies between stocks that rapidly evolve. In addition, these methods often ignore the hierarchical features of the stocks and lose distinctive information within. In this work, we propose a novel graph learning approach implemented without expert knowledge to address these issues. First, our approach automatically constructs dynamic stock graphs by entropy-driven edge generation from a signal processing perspective. Then, we further learn task-optimal dependencies between stocks via a generalized graph diffusion process on constructed stock graphs. Last, a decoupled representation learning scheme is adopted to capture distinctive hierarchical intra-stock features. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets. Moreover, the ablation study and sensitivity study further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in modeling the time-evolving inter-stock and intra-stock dynamics."}, {"index": 33, "title": "Natural Language Processing and Multimodal Stock Price Prediction", "abstract": "In the realm of financial decision-making, predicting stock prices is pivotal.

We train the RL traders in a multi-agent market simulation platform, ABIDES, and compare the strategies of traders trained with and without bubble experience. We find that RL traders without bubble experience behave like short-term momentum traders, whereas traders with bubble experience behave like value traders. Therefore, RL traders without bubble experience amplify bubbles, whereas RL traders with bubble experience tend to suppress and sometimes prevent them. This finding suggests that learning from experience is a mechanism for a boom and bust cycle where the experience of a collapsing bubble makes future bubbles less likely for a period of time until the memory fades and bubbles become more likely to form again."}, {"index": 36, "title": "MASTER: Market-Guided Stock Transformer for Stock Price Forecasting", "abstract": "Stock price forecasting has remained an extremely challenging problem for many decades due to the high volatility of the stock market. Recent efforts have been devoted to modeling complex stock correlations toward joint stock price forecasting. Existing works share a common neural architecture that learns temporal patterns from individual stock series and then mixes up temporal representations to establish stock correlations. However, they only consider time-aligned stock correlations stemming from all the input stock features, which suffer from two limitations. First, stock correlations often occur momentarily and in a cross-time manner. Second, the feature effectiveness is dynamic with market variation, which affects both the stock sequential patterns and their correlations. To address the limitations, this paper introduces MASTER, a MArkert-Guided Stock TransformER, which models the momentary and cross-time stock correlation and leverages market information for automatic feature selection. MASTER elegantly tackles the complex stock correlation by alternatively engaging in intra-stock and inter-stock information aggregation.

The proposed model, ResNLS, is mainly composed of two neural architectures, ResNet and LSTM. ResNet serves as a feature extractor to identify dependencies between stock prices across time windows, while LSTM analyses the initial time-series data with the combination of dependencies which considered as residuals. In predicting the SSE Composite Index, our experiment reveals that when the closing price data for the previous 5 consecutive trading days is used as the input, the performance of the model (ResNLS-5) is optimal compared to those with other inputs. Furthermore, ResNLS-5 outperforms vanilla CNN, RNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM models in terms of prediction accuracy. It also demonstrates at least a 20% improvement over the current state-of-the-art baselines. To verify whether ResNLS-5 can help clients effectively avoid risks and earn profits in the stock market, we construct a quantitative trading framework for back testing.

In this study, the edge-centric discrete Ricci curvatures have been employed for the first time in the analysis of the Indian stock markets. The Indian stock markets are known to be less diverse in comparison to the US market, and hence provides us an interesting example. Our results point that, among the persistent homology based topological measures, persistent entropy is simple and more robust than $L^1$-norm and $L^2$-norm of persistence landscape. In a broader comparison between network analysis and TDA, we highlight that the network analysis is sensitive to the way of constructing the networks (threshold or minimum spanning tree), as well as the threshold values used to construct the correlation-based threshold networks. On the other hand, the persistent homology is a more robust approach and is able to capture the higher-order interactions and eliminate noisy data in financial systems, since it does not take into account a single value of threshold but rather a range of values."}, {"index": 41, "title": "Information Content of Financial Youtube Channel: Case Study of 3PROTV and Korean Stock Market", "abstract": "We investigate the information content of 3PROTV, a south Korean financial youtube channel.

The LPCMCI results indicate the existence of potential latent confounders. Our results demonstrate that VAR-LiNGAM uniquely identifies the directed acyclic graph (DAG), and thus provides informative insight into the causal relationship when the assumptions are considered valid.

Current forecasting methods on this task frequently produce unsatisfactory results due to the inherent data randomness and instability, thereby underscoring the demand for advanced forecasting models. Given the superiority of capsule network (CapsNet) over CNN in various forecasting and classification tasks, this study investigates the potential of integrating a 1D CapsNet with an LSTM network for multi-step stock index forecasting. To this end, a hybrid 1D-CapsNet-LSTM model is introduced, which utilizes a 1D CapsNet to generate high-level capsules from sequential data and a LSTM network to capture temporal dependencies. To maintain stochastic dependencies over different forecasting horizons, a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) strategy is employed. The model's performance is evaluated on real-world stock market indices, including S&P 500, DJIA, IXIC, and NYSE, and compared to baseline models, including LSTM, RNN, and CNN-LSTM, using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and TIC. The proposed 1D-CapsNet-LSTM model consistently outperforms baseline models in two key aspects. It exhibits significant reductions in forecasting errors compared to baseline models.

This bias can take two forms: a look-ahead bias, in which the LLM may have specific knowledge of the stock returns that followed a news article, and a distraction effect, in which general knowledge of the companies named interferes with the measurement of a text's sentiment. We investigate these sources of bias through trading strategies driven by the sentiment of financial news headlines. We compare trading performance based on the original headlines with de-biased strategies in which we remove the relevant company's identifiers from the text. In-sample (within the LLM training window), we find, surprisingly, that the anonymized headlines outperform, indicating that the distraction effect has a greater impact than look-ahead bias. This tendency is particularly strong for larger companies--companies about which we expect an LLM to have greater general knowledge.

To this end, some stock exchanges implement a price limit or a circuit breaker, and there has been intensive investigation into which regulation best prevents rapid and large variations in price. In this study, we examine this question using an artificial market model that is an agent-based model for a financial market. Our findings show that the price limit and the circuit breaker basically have the same effect when the parameters, limit price range and limit time range, are the same. However, the price limit is less effective when limit the time range is smaller than the cancel time range. With the price limit, many sell orders are accumulated around the lower limit price, and when the lower limit price is changed before the accumulated sell orders are cancelled, it leads to the accumulation of sell orders of various prices. These accumulated sell orders essentially act as a wall against buy orders, thereby preventing price from rising. Caution should be taken in the sense that these results pertain to a limited situation. Specifically, our finding that the circuit breaker is better than the price limit should be adapted only in cases where the reason for falling prices is erroneous orders and when individual stocks are regulated."}, {"index": 72, "title": "Incorporating Pre-trained Model Prompting in Multimodal Stock Volume Movement Prediction", "abstract": "Multimodal stock trading volume movement prediction with stock-related news is one of the fundamental problems in the financial area.

Storage theory gives reason to believe that the correlation is an increasing function of stocks carried over from previous years. Stock-conditioned second moments have implications for price movements during shortages and for hedging needs, while spatially varying yield-price correlation structures have implications for who benefits from commodity support policies. In this paper, we propose to use semi-parametric quantile regression (SQR) with penalized B-splines to estimate a stock-conditioned joint distribution of yield and price. The proposed method, validated through a comprehensive simulation study, enables sampling from the true joint distribution using SQR. Then it is applied to approximate stock-conditioned correlation and revenue insurance premium for both corn and soybeans in the United States. For both crops, Cornbelt core regions have more negative correlations than do peripheral regions. We find strong evidence that correlation becomes less negative as stocks increase. We also show that conditioning on stocks is important when calculating actuarially fair revenue insurance premiums. In particular, revenue insurance premiums in the Cornbelt core will be biased upward if the model for calculating premiums does not allow correlation to vary with stocks available. The stock-dependent correlation can be viewed as a form of tail dependence that, if unacknowledged, leads to mispricing of revenue insurance products."}, {"index": 79, "title": "Modelling Structural Breaks In Stock Price Time Series Using Stochastic Differential Equations", "abstract": "This paper studies the effect of quarterly earnings reports on the stock price.

Additionally, most financial regulators also require a liquidity horizon of several days for institutional investors to exit their risky assets, in order to not materially affect market prices. However, the task of multi-step stock price prediction is challenging, given the highly stochastic nature of stock data. Current solutions to tackle this problem are mostly designed for single-step, classification-based predictions, and are limited to low representation expressiveness. The problem also gets progressively harder with the introduction of the target price sequence, which also contains stochastic noise and reduces generalizability at test-time. To tackle these issues, we combine a deep hierarchical variational-autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion probabilistic techniques to do seq2seq stock prediction through a stochastic generative process. The hierarchical VAE allows us to learn the complex and low-level latent variables for stock prediction, while the diffusion probabilistic model trains the predictor to handle stock price stochasticity by progressively adding random noise to the stock data. Our Diffusion-VAE (D-Va) model is shown to outperform state-of-the-art solutions in terms of its prediction accuracy and variance.

Indeed, in 2005, Lillo, Mike, and Farmer (LMF) introduced a microscopic model of the order-splitting traders to predict the asymptotic behavior of the LRC from the microscopic dynamics, even quantitatively. The plausibility of this scenario has been qualitatively investigated by Toth et al. 2015.

We address the question of whether these values belong to one of the three categories: Black Swans (BS), that is they lie on scale-free, power-law tails of the distribution; Dragon Kings (DK), defined as statistically significant upward deviations from BS; or Negative Dragons Kings (nDK), defined as statistically significant downward deviations from BS. In analyzing the tails of the distribution with RV > 40, we observe the appearance of \"potential\" DK which eventually terminate in an abrupt plunge to nDK. This phenomenon becomes more pronounced with the increase of the number of days over which the average RV is calculated -- here from daily, n=1, to \"monthly,\" n=21. We fit the entire distribution with a modified Generalized Beta (mGB) distribution function, which terminates at a finite value of the variable but exhibits a long power-law stretch prior to that, as well as Generalized Beta Prime (GB2) distribution function, which has a power-law tail. We also fit the tails directly with a straight line on a log-log scale.

We present a novel approach to predict long-term daily stock price change trends with fully 2D-convolutional encoder-decoders. We generate input frames with daily prices for a time-frame of T days. The aim is to predict future trends by pixel-wise classification of the current price frame. We propose a hierarchical CNN structure to encode multiple price frames to multiscale latent representation in parallel using Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling blocks and take that temporal coarse feature stacks into account in the decoding stages. Our hierarchical structure of CNNs makes it capable of capturing both long and short-term temporal relationships effectively. The effect of increasing the input time horizon via incrementing parallel encoders has been studied with interesting and substantial changes in the output segmentation masks. We achieve overall accuracy and AUC of %78.18 and 0.88 for joint trend prediction over the next 20 days, surpassing other semantic segmentation approaches.

Despite such significant efforts, the results remain unsatisfactory due to the inherently complicated nature of the stock market driven by factors including supply and demand, the state of the economy, the political climate, and even irrational human behavior. Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been extended for time series data; however, robust methods are primarily for synthetic series generation, which fall short for appropriate stock prediction. This is because existing GANs for stock applications suffer from mode collapse and only consider one-step prediction, thus underutilizing the potential of GAN. Furthermore, merging news and market volatility are neglected in current GANs. To address these issues, we exploit expert domain knowledge in finance and, for the first time, attempt to formulate stock movement prediction into a Wasserstein GAN framework for multi-step prediction. We propose IndexGAN, which includes deliberate designs for the inherent characteristics of the stock market, leverages news context learning to thoroughly investigate textual information and develop an attentive seq2seq learning network that captures the temporal dependency among stock prices, news, and market sentiment. We also utilize the critic to approximate the Wasserstein distance between actual and predicted sequences and develop a rolling strategy for deployment that mitigates noise from the financial market.

VMD-MFRFNN, an approach based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and MFRFNN, brings together their advantages. VMD-MFRFNN consists of two phases. The input signal is decomposed to several IMFs using VMD in the decomposition phase. In the prediction and reconstruction phase, each of the IMFs is given to a separate MFRFNN for prediction, and predicted signals are summed to reconstruct the output. Three financial time series, including Hang Seng Index (HSI), Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), and Standard & Poor's 500 Index (SPX), are used for the evaluation of the proposed methods. Experimental results indicate that VMD-MFRFNN surpasses other state-of-the-art methods.

The challenge in this paper is to make an investment strategy that combines high predictive power and the ability to quantify uncertainty. We propose a novel approach called Uncertainty Aware Trader-Company Method~(UTC) method. The core idea of this approach is to combine the strengths of both frameworks by merging the TC method with the probabilistic modeling, which provides probabilistic predictions and uncertainty estimations. We expect this to retain the predictive power and interpretability of the TC method while capturing the uncertainty. We theoretically prove that the proposed method estimates the posterior variance and does not introduce additional biases from the original TC method.

The analysis results show that biases generally exhibit the same characteristics, strongly supporting the true fundamentals hypothesis. Notably, the positive price-to-cash flows from the investing activities ratio is a proxy for the true fundamentals. Where do these biases come from? The answer is extremely simple: ``Cash is a fact, profit is an opinion.'' Namely, opinions of management and accounting are added to true fundamentals.

Previous methods mostly learn a universal model for different stocks. However, this kind of practice omits the specific characteristics of individual stocks by applying the same set of parameters for different stocks. On the other hand, learning different models for each stock would face data sparsity or cold start problems for many stocks with small capitalization. To take advantage of the data scale and the various characteristics of individual stocks, we propose a dual-process meta-learning method that treats the prediction of each stock as one task under the meta-learning framework. Our method can model the common pattern behind different stocks with a meta-learner, while modeling the specific pattern for each stock across time spans with stock-dependent parameters. Furthermore, we propose to mine the pattern of each stock in the form of a latent variable which is then used for learning the parameters for the prediction module. This makes the prediction procedure aware of the data pattern. Extensive experiments on volume predictions show that our method can improve the performance of various baseline models.

In this work, we provide statistical evidence for the result promulgation influence on the public pharma market value. Whereas most works focus on retrospective impact analysis, the present research aims to predict the numerical values of announcement-induced changes in stock prices. For this purpose, we develop a pipeline that includes a BERT-based model for extracting sentiment polarity of announcements, a Temporal Fusion Transformer for forecasting the expected return, a graph convolution network for capturing event relationships, and gradient boosting for predicting the price change. The challenge of the problem lies in inherently different patterns of responses to positive and negative announcements, reflected in a stronger and more pronounced reaction to the negative news. Moreover, such phenomenon as the drop in stocks after the positive announcements affirms the counterintuitiveness of the price behavior. Importantly, we discover two crucial factors that should be considered while working within a predictive framework. The first factor is the drug portfolio size of the company, indicating the greater susceptibility to an announcement in the case of small drug diversification. The second one is the network effect of the events related to the same company or nosology.

Specifically, we turn the regression model into a probabilistic forecasting model, by training models to predict a Gaussian distribution to which the trading volume belongs. The student model can thus learn from the teacher at a more informative distributional level, by matching its predicted distributions to that of the teacher. Two correlational distillation objectives are further introduced to encourage the student to produce consistent pair-wise relationships with the teacher model. We evaluate the framework on a real-world stock volume dataset with two different time window settings.

Given the generically falling prices during the lockdown, the households, which are typically contrarian, were net buyers, even if less than expected from their trading activity in 2019.

In order to verify the MACD effectiveness, in this thesis, I use the MACD indicator with traditional parameters (12, 26, 9) to build various trading strategies. Then, I apply these strategies to stocks listed on three indices in the US stock market (i.e., Dow-Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500) and evaluate its performance in terms of win rate, profitability, Sharpe ratio, number of trades and maximum drawdown. The backtesting is programmed using Python, covering the period between 01/01/2015 and 28-08-2021. The result shows that the win-rate of the strategy with only the MACD indicator is less than 50%. However, the win-rate is improved for the trading strategies that combine the MACD indicator with other momentum indicators like the Money Flow Index (MFI) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Based on this result, I redesign the MACD mathematical formula by taking the trading volume and daily price volatility into consideration to derive a new indicator called VPVMA. The results show that the win-rate and risk-adjust performance of this new trading strategy have been improved significantly. In general, the findings suggest that while all the MACD trading strategies mentioned above can generate positive returns, the performance is not good without using other momentum indicators. Hence, the VPVMA indicator performs better."}, {"index": 190, "title": "Predicting Day-Ahead Stock Returns using Search Engine Query Volumes: An Application of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees to the S&P 100", "abstract": "The internet has changed the way we live, work and take decisions.

In an empirical analysis it implements gradient boosted decision trees to learn relationships between abnormal returns of stocks within the S&P 100 index and lagged predictors derived from historical financial data, as well as search term query volumes on the internet search engine Google. Models predict the occurrence of day-ahead stock returns in excess of the index median. On a time frame from 2005 to 2017, all disparate datasets exhibit valuable information. Evaluated models have average areas under the receiver operating characteristic between 54.2% and 56.7%, clearly indicating a classification better than random guessing. Implementing a simple statistical arbitrage strategy, models are used to create daily trading portfolios of ten stocks and result in annual performances of more than 57% before transaction costs. With ensembles of different data sets topping up the performance ranking, the results further question the weak form and semi-strong form efficiency of modern financial capital markets.

We adjust the intraday intrinsic entropy model that we introduced earlier for exchange-traded securities in order to connect daily OHLC prices with the ratio of the corresponding daily volume to the overall volume traded in the considered period. The intrinsic entropy model conceptualizes this ratio as entropic probability or market credence assigned to the corresponding price level. The intrinsic entropy is computed using historical daily data for traded market indices (S&P 500, Dow 30, NYSE Composite, NASDAQ Composite, Nikkei 225, and Hang Seng Index). We compare the results produced by the intrinsic entropy model with the volatility estimates obtained for the same data sets using widely employed industry volatility estimators.

The standard Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks are regarded as the state-of-the-art models for such predictions. But, these models fail to handle sudden and drastic changes in the price trend. Moreover, there are some inherent constraints with the open, high, low and close (OHLC) prices of the stocks. Literature lacks the study on the inherent property of OHLC prices. We argue that predicting the OHLC prices for the next day is much more informative than predicting the trends of the stocks as the trend is mostly calculated using these OHLC prices only. The problem mainly is focused on Buy-Today Sell-Tomorrow (BTST) trading. In this regard, AEs when pre-trained with the stock prices, may be beneficial. A novel framework is proposed where a pre-trained encoder is cascaded in front of the multi-task predictor network. This hybrid network can leverage the power of a combination of networks and can both handle the OHLC constraints as well as capture any sudden drastic changes in the prices. It is seen that such a network is much more efficient at predicting stock prices. The experiments have been extended to recommend the most profitable and most overbought stocks on the next day.

These indicators serve as input variable to the Fuzzy System. The MACD and SO are deployed as primary indicators, while the RSI and WA are used as secondary indicators. Fibonacci retracement ratio was adopted for the secondary indicators to determine their support and resistance level in terms of making trading decisions. The input variables to the Fuzzy System is fuzzified to Low, Medium, and High using the Triangular and Gaussian Membership Function. The Mamdani Type Fuzzy Inference rules were used for combining the trading rules for each input variable to the fuzzy system.

Yet, it is well-known that the decision-makers routinely use soft text-based documents that interpret the hard data they narrate. Recent advances in computational methods for analyzing unstructured and soft text-based data at scale offer possibilities for understanding financial market behavior that could improve investments and market equity. A critical and ubiquitous form of soft data are earnings calls. Earnings calls are periodic (often quarterly) statements usually by CEOs who attempt to influence investors' expectations of a company's past and future performance. Here, we study the statistical relationship between earnings calls, company sales, stock performance, and analysts' recommendations. Our study covers a decade of observations with approximately 100,000 transcripts of earnings calls from 6,300 public companies from January 2010 to December 2019. In this study, we report three novel findings. First, the buy, sell and hold recommendations from professional analysts made prior to the earnings have low correlation with stock price movements after the earnings call. Second, using our graph neural network based method that processes the semantic features of earnings calls, we reliably and accurately predict stock price movements in five major areas of the economy. Third, the semantic features of transcripts are more predictive of stock price movements than sales and earnings per share, i.e., traditional hard data in most of the cases."}, {"index": 221, "title": "Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models for Stock Price Prediction", "abstract": "In this work, we apply machine learning techniques to historical stock prices to forecast future prices.

We quantify the results of these models by computing the error of the predicted values versus the historical values of each stock. We find that of the algorithms we investigated, a simple linear Kalman filter can predict the next-day value of stocks with low-volatility (e.g., Microsoft) surprisingly well. However, in the case of high-volatility stocks (e.g., Tesla) the more complex LSTM algorithms significantly outperform the Kalman filter.

Well-known nonparametric kernel smoother and $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) estimator, which take label average over a ball around the query, are consistent but asymptotically biased particularly for a large radius of the ball. To eradicate such bias, local polynomial regression (LPoR) and multiscale $k$-NN (MS-$k$-NN) learn the bias term by local regression around the query and extrapolate it to the query itself.

The predictions had an overall accuracy of 83.62% with a precision of 85% for buy signals and a recall of 100% for sell signals. Moreover, we grouped equities by their sector and repeated the experiment to see if grouping similar assets together positively effected the results but concluded that it showed no significant improvements in the performance rejecting the idea of sector-based analysis. Also, using feature ranking we could identify an even smaller set of 6 indicators while maintaining similar accuracies as that from the original 28 features and also uncovered the importance of buy, hold and sell analyst ratings as they came out to be the top contributors in the model.

We investigate GME stock for its volatility and compare it to SPY as a benchmark (since it is a less volatile ETF fund) from February 2002 to February 2021. For strategy 1, we develop a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network to predict stock prices recurrently with a very short look ahead period in the presence of extreme volatility. For our strategy 2, we develop an LSTM autoencoder network specifically designed to trade only on consolidation breakouts after predicting anomalies in the stock price. When back-tested in our simulations, our strategy 1 executes 863 trades for SPY and 452 trades for GME. Our strategy 2 executes 931 trades for SPY and 325 trades for GME. We compare both strategies to buying and holding one single share for the period that we picked as a benchmark.

Its prediction results cannot represent the most critical financial direction attributes. So it cannot provide investors with convincing, interpretable, and consistent model performance evaluation results for practical applications in the securities market. To illustrate, we have used data selected from 20 stock datasets over six years from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock market in China, and 20 stock datasets from NASDAQ and NYSE in the USA. We implement six shallow and deep neural networks to predict stock prices and use four prediction error measures for evaluation. The results show that the prediction error value only partially reflects the model accuracy of the stock price prediction, and cannot reflect the change in the direction of the model predicted stock price. This characteristic determines that PE is not suitable as an evaluation indicator of NNSPP. Otherwise, it will bring huge potential risks to investors.

First, in financial markets, there is no single model that can consistently make accurate prediction because traders in markets quickly adapt to newly available information. Instead, there are a number of ephemeral and partially correct models called \"alpha factors\". Second, since financial markets are highly uncertain, ensuring interpretability of prediction models is quite important to make reliable trading strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Trader-Company method, a novel evolutionary model that mimics the roles of a financial institute and traders belonging to it. Our method predicts future stock returns by aggregating suggestions from multiple weak learners called Traders. A Trader holds a collection of simple mathematical formulae, each of which represents a candidate of an alpha factor and would be interpretable for real-world investors.

The effect of a mainshock in the form of aftershocks can be felt throughout the recovery phase of stock price.

The duration of the recovery phase has been estimated using structural break analysis. We have carried out statistical analyses of the 1987 stock market crash, 2008 financial crisis and 2020 COVID-19 pandemic considering the actual crash-times of the mainshock and aftershocks. Earlier, such analyses were done considering an absolute one-day return, which cannot capture a crash properly. The results show that the mainshock and aftershock in the stock market follow the Gutenberg-Richter (GR) power law. Further, we obtained a higher $\\beta$ value for the COVID-19 crash compared to the financial-crisis-2008 from the GR law. This implies that the recovery of stock price during COVID-19 may be faster than the financial-crisis-2008. The result is consistent with the present recovery of the market from the COVID-19 pandemic.

This research reports the effects of imperfect oracles on the system - dispensing noisy information about strategies - information which would normally be hidden from market participants. The effect and achievable profits of a singular trader with access to an oracle were tested exhaustively with previously unexplored factors such as changing order schedules.

This type of financial product was proposed as an instrument for stabilizing the global banking system after the financial crisis. Yet it was recognized early on that these products may create circularity problems in the definition of stock prices - even in the absence of trade. We find that if conversion thresholds are such that bond holders are indifferent about marginal conversions, there exists a unique equilibrium irrespective of the network structure. When thresholds are lower, existence of equilibrium breaks down while higher thresholds may lead to multiplicity of equilibria. Moreover, there are complex network effects. One bank's conversion may trigger further conversions - or prevent them, depending on the constellations of asset values and conversion triggers."}, {"index": 315, "title": "Pattern recognition in micro-trading behaviors before stock price jumps: A framework based on multivariate time series analysis", "abstract": "Studying the micro-trading behaviors before stock price jumps is an important problem for financial regulations and investment decisions.

Moreover, it can explore the joint informativeness of the attributes as well as select a subset of highly informative but minimally redundant attributes to analyze the homogeneous and idiosyncratic patterns in the pre-jump trades of individual stocks. In addition, our analysis involves a set of technical indicators to describe micro-trading behaviors. To illustrate the viability of the proposed methodology, an application case is conducted based on the level-2 data of 189 constituent stocks of the China Security Index 300.

To forecast the open values of the NIFTY 50 index records, we adopted a multi step prediction technique with walk forward validation. In this approach, the open values of the NIFTY 50 index are predicted on a time horizon of one week, and once a week is over, the actual index values are included in the training set before the model is trained again, and the forecasts for the next week are made. We present detailed results on the forecasting accuracies for all our proposed models. The results show that while all the models are very accurate in forecasting the NIFTY 50 open values, the univariate encoder decoder convolutional LSTM with the previous two weeks data as the input is the most accurate model.

Despite this risk, the trading domain remains largely unexplored in the context of adversarial learning. In this study, we present a realistic scenario in which an attacker influences algorithmic trading systems by using adversarial learning techniques to manipulate the input data stream in real time. The attacker creates a universal perturbation that is agnostic to the target model and time of use, which, when added to the input stream, remains imperceptible. We evaluate our attack on a real-world market data stream and target three different trading algorithms. We show that when added to the input stream, our perturbation can fool the trading algorithms at future unseen data points, in both white-box and black-box settings. Finally, we present various mitigation methods and discuss their limitations, which stem from the algorithmic trading domain.

In the meantime, a significant appreciation of stock prices is observed during the normal state of capital flows.

This highlights the necessity of treating the observations as matrix-valued rather than vector-valued. With matrix-valued observations, our problem of interest can be formulated as statistical inference on covariance structures under sub-Gaussian distributions, i.e., testing non-correlation and correlation equality, as well as the corresponding support estimations.

We employ heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models allowing for three types of asymmetry: positive and negative realized semivariance (RSV), asymmetric jumps, and leverage effects. The estimation results show that leverage effects clearly influence the modeling of realized volatility models. Leverage effects exist for both the spot and futures markets in the Nikkei 225. Although realized semivariance aids better modeling, the estimations of RSV models depend on whether these models have leverage effects. Asymmetric jump components do not have a clear influence on realized volatility models. While leverage effects and realized semivariance also improve the out-of-sample forecast performance of volatility models, asymmetric jumps are not useful for predictive ability. The empirical results of this study indicate that asymmetric information, in particular, leverage effects and realized semivariance, yield better modeling and more accurate forecast performance. Accordingly, asymmetric information should be included when we model and forecast the realized volatility of Japanese stock markets."}, {"index": 348, "title": "A Novel Distributed Representation of News (DRNews) for Stock Market Predictions", "abstract": "In this study, a novel Distributed Representation of News (DRNews) model is developed and applied in deep learning-based stock market predictions.

Two stock market prediction tasks, namely the short-term stock movement prediction and stock crises early warning, are implemented in the framework of the attention-based Long Short Term-Memory (LSTM) network. It is suggested that DRNews substantially enhances the results of both tasks comparing with five baselines of news embedding models.

Previous works typically predict the stock price mainly based on its own information, neglecting the cross effect among involved stocks. However, it is well known that an individual stock price is correlated with prices of other stocks in complex ways. To take the cross effect into consideration, we propose a deep learning framework, called Multi-GCGRU, which comprises graph convolutional network (GCN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to predict stock movement. Specifically, we first encode multiple relationships among stocks into graphs based on financial domain knowledge and utilize GCN to extract the cross effect based on these pre-defined graphs. To further get rid of prior knowledge, we explore an adaptive relationship learned by data automatically. The cross-correlation features produced by GCN are concatenated with historical records and then fed into GRU to model the temporal dependency of stock prices. Experiments on two stock indexes in China market show that our model outperforms other baselines.

The decline and recovery in the index were estimated for the following three months after the initial point of the predicted trend. The forecast is a projection of a prediction with stochastic fluctuations described by $q$-gaussian diffusion process with three spatio-temporal regimes. Our forecast was made on the premise that any market response can be decomposed into an overall deterministic trend and a stochastic term. The prediction was based on the deterministic part and for this case study is approximated by the extrapolation of the S\\&P500 data trend in the initial stages of the outbreak.

Design of such predictive models requires choice of appropriate variables, right transformation methods of the variables, and tuning of the parameters of the models.

Given its associations with fear and the fine resolution with respect to frequency, the illiquidity of stocks may offer a promising perspective for understanding and even signaling a market crash. In this study, by connecting stocks with illiquidity comovements, an illiquidity network is established to model the market. Compared to noncrash days, on crash days, the market is more densely connected due to heavier but more homogeneous illiquidity dependencies that facilitate abrupt collapses. Critical stocks in the illiquidity network, particularly those in the finance sector, are targeted for inspection because of their crucial roles in accumulating and passing on illiquidity losses. The cascading failures of stocks in market crashes are profiled as disseminating from small degrees to high degrees that are usually located in the core of the illiquidity network and then back to the periphery. By counting the days with random failures in the previous five days, an early signal is implemented to successfully predict more than half of the crash days, especially consecutive days in the early phase. Additional evidence from both the Granger causality network and the random network further testifies to the robustness of the signal.

However, after analyzing the available data, it indicated otherwise, the stock price performance as discussed indicates a different pattern. The stock price data is analyzed with an unconventional tool, Weibull distribution and observations confirmed the presence of either a reverse trend in franchised business than what is observed for non-franchised or the franchised stock followed large food suppliers. There is a layered ownership and cash flow in a franchised business model. The parent company run by franchiser depends on the performance of child companies run by franchisees. Both parent and child companies are run as independent businesses but only the parent company is listed as a stock ticker in stock exchange.

Each agent is represented by a spin having a number of discrete states $q$ or continuous states, describing the tendency of the agent for buying or selling. The market ambiance is represented by a parameter $T$ which plays the role of the temperature in physics. We show that there is a critical value of $T$, say $T_c$, where strong fluctuations between individual states lead to a disordered situation in which there is no majority: the numbers of sellers and buyers are equal, namely the market clearing. We have considered three models: $q=3$ ( sell, buy, wait), $q=5$ (5 states between absolutely buy and absolutely sell), and $q=\\infty$. The specific measure, by the government or by economic organisms, is parameterized by $H$ applied on the market at the time $t_1$ and removed at the time $t_2$. We have used Monte Carlo simulations to study the time evolution of the price as functions of those parameters. Many striking results are obtained. In particular we show that the price strongly fluctuates near $T_c$ and there exists a critical value $H_c$ above which the boosting effect remains after $H$ is removed. This happens only if $H$ is applied in the critical region. Otherwise, the effect of $H$ lasts only during the time of the application of $H$. The second party of the paper deals with the price variation using a time-dependent mean-field theory. By supposing that the sellers and the buyers belong to two distinct communities with their characteristics different in both intra-group and inter-group interactions, we find the price oscillation with time."}, {"index": 383, "title": "DP-LSTM: Differential Privacy-inspired LSTM for Stock Prediction Using Financial News", "abstract": "Stock price prediction is important for value investments in the stock market.

We incorporate the predictability of stock returns into the well-known Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Empirically, we analyze the option and spot trader's market predictability of stock prices by defining a forward-looking measure which we call \"implied excess predictability\". The empirical results indicate the effect of option trader's predictability of stock returns on the price of stock options is an increasing function of moneyness, while this effect is decreasing for spot traders. These empirical results indicate potential asymmetric predictability of stock prices by spot and option traders. We show in pricing options with the strike price significantly higher or lower than the stock price, the predictability of the underlying stock's return should be incorporated into the option pricing formula. In pricing options that have moneyness close to one, stock return predictability is not incorporated into the option pricing model because stock return predictability is the same for both types of traders.

This study aims to discover whether it is news or stock prices that have a greater impact on the other. To achieve this, we analyze the relationship between news sentiment and stock prices based on time series analysis using five different classification models.

We consider the closing price and daily return of three different stocks for this investigation. We collected our social media data from Sahamyab.com/stocktwits for about three months. To extract information from online comments, we propose a hybrid sentiment analysis approach that combines lexicon-based and learning-based methods. Since lexicons that are available for the Persian language are not practical for sentiment analysis in the stock market domain, we built a particular sentiment lexicon for this domain. After designing and calculating daily sentiment indices using the sentiment of the comments, we examine their impact on the baseline models that only use historical market data and propose new predictor models using multi regression analysis. In addition to the sentiments, we also examine the comments volume and the users' reliabilities. We conclude that the predictability of various stocks in TSE is different depending on their attributes. Moreover, we indicate that for predicting the closing price only comments volume and for predicting the daily return both the volume and the sentiment of the comments could be useful. We demonstrate that Users' Trust coefficients have different behaviors toward the three stocks."}, {"index": 413, "title": "Stock Price Forecasting and Hypothesis Testing Using Neural Networks", "abstract": "In this work we use Recurrent Neural Networks and Multilayer Perceptrons to predict NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX stock prices from historical data.

Using a simplified dynamic model on networks of investors and stocks, an unexpected linear association between price limit and critical market confidence is theoretically derived and empirically verified in this paper. Our results highlight the importance of relatively `small' but critical stocks that drive the system to collapse by passing the failure from periphery to core. These small stocks, largely originating from homogeneous investment strategies across the market, has unintentionally suppressed system resilience with the exclusive increment of individual risk tolerance.

Numerous approaches were developed to accurately predict future trends in stock prices. Recently, there has been a growing interest in utilizing graph-structured data in computer science research communities. Methods that use relational data for stock market prediction have been recently proposed, but they are still in their infancy. First, the quality of collected information from different types of relations can vary considerably. No existing work has focused on the effect of using different types of relations on stock market prediction or finding an effective way to selectively aggregate information on different relation types. Furthermore, existing works have focused on only individual stock prediction which is similar to the node classification task. To address this, we propose a hierarchical attention network for stock prediction (HATS) which uses relational data for stock market prediction. Our HATS method selectively aggregates information on different relation types and adds the information to the representations of each company. Specifically, node representations are initialized with features extracted from a feature extraction module. HATS is used as a relational modeling module with initialized node representations. Then, node representations with the added information are fed into a task-specific layer. Our method is used for predicting not only individual stock prices but also market index movements, which is similar to the graph classification task. The experimental results show that performance can change depending on the relational data used.

Three statistical evaluation measures are used to compare the results of the implemented models, namely the root mean squared error, the mean absolute percentage error and the mean absolution deviation. The computational results obtained reveal that the symbiotic organisms search trained feedforward neural network model exhibits outstanding predictive performance compared to the other models.

Analysis of resilient market performance, therefore, becomes useful for investors. From a systems perspective, this paper proposes a novel function-based resilience metric that considers the effect of two fault-tolerance thresholds: the Robustness Range (RR) and the Elasticity Threshold (ET). We examined the consecutive resilience cycles and their dynamics in the performance of two stock markets, NASDAQ and SSE. The proposed metric was also compared with three well-documented resilience models. The results showed that this new metric could satisfactorily quantify the time-varying resilience cycles in the multi-cycle volatile performance of stock markets while also being more feasible in comparative analysis. Furthermore, analysis of dynamics revealed that those consecutive resilience cycles in market performance were distributed non-linearly, following a power-law behavior in the upper tail. Finally, sensitivity tests demonstrated the large-value resilience cycles were relatively sensitive to changes in RR. In practice, RR could indicate investors' psychological capability to withstand downturns. It supports the observation that perception on the market's resilient responses may vary among investors.

The influence on the numerical results of forecast horizons and of uncertainties due to inaccuracies in the weather and room occupancy forecasts, are analyzed. As we solve non-convex optimization problems using a linear and a nonlinear optimizer, full MPC performance is compared to both linearized MPC and a standard on/off controller. The main advantage of MPC is its ability to provide satisfactory solutions for microclimate control at the least possible energy cost for both modern and old buildings. As old buildings are usually not properly ventilated, we see in light of our simulation results, that a supply ventilation system installation provides a solution for significant air quality improvement."}, {"index": 479, "title": "Multifractal characteristics and return predictability in the Chinese stock markets", "abstract": "By adopting Multifractal detrended fluctuation (MF-DFA) analysis methods, the multifractal nature is revealed in the high-frequency data of two typical indexes, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite 180 Index (SH180) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Composite Index (SZCI).

For a simple model of geometric Brownian motion of a single stock we show that our calculated Kelly fraction agrees with existing results.

We generate complex networks from a cross-correlation matrix such as the threshold network (TN) and the minimal spanning tree (MST). In the threshold network, we assign a threshold value by using the mean and standard deviation of cross-correlation coefficients. When the threshold is equal to the mean of these coefficients, we observe a giant cluster composed of three economic zones in all three periods. We find that during the crisis, the countries in the Asian zone were weakly connected and those in the American zone were tightly linked to the countries in the European zone. At a large threshold, the three economic zones were fragmented. The European countries connected tightly, but the Asian countries bound weakly. The MST constructed from the distance matrix. In the MST, France remained a hub node in all three periods. The size of the MST shrank slightly during the crisis. We observe a scaling relation between the network distance of nodes from the central hub (France) and the geometrical distance. We observe the topological change of the financial network structure during the global financial crisis. The TN and MST are complementary roles to understand the connecting structure of financial complex networks. The TN reveals to observe the clustering effects and robustness of the cluster during the financial crisis.

This followed a 666-point loss on the second, and another drop of over a thousand points occurred three days later. It is natural to ask whether these events indicate a transition to a new regime of market behavior, particularly given the dramatic fluctuations --- both gains and losses --- in the weeks since. To illuminate this matter, we can apply a model grounded in the science of complex systems, a model that demonstrated considerable success at unraveling the stock-market dynamics from the 1980s through the 2000s. By using large-scale comovement of stock prices as an early indicator of unhealthy market dynamics, this work found that abrupt drops in a certain parameter $U$ provide an early warning of single-day panics and economic crises. Decreases in $U$ indicate regimes of \"high co-movement\", a market behavior that is not the same as volatility, though market volatility can be a component of co-movement. Applying the same analysis to stock-price data from the beginning of 2016 until now, we find that the $U$ value for the period since 5 February is significantly lower than for the period before. This decrease entered the \"danger zone\" in the last week of May, 2018."}, {"index": 483, "title": "Comparing Alternatives to Measure the Impact of DDoS Attack Announcements on Target Stock Prices", "abstract": "The attack intensity of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is increasing every year. Botnets based on internet of things (IOT) devices are now being used to conduct DDoS attacks. The estimation of direct and indirect economic damages caused by these attacks is a complex problem. One of the indirect damage of a DDoS attack can be on the market value of the victim firm. In this article we analyze the impact of 45 different DDoS attack announcements on victim's stock prices. We find that previous studies have a mixed conclusion on the impact of DDoS attack announcements on the victim's stock price. Hence, in this article we evaluate this impact using three different approaches and compare the results. In the first approach, we use the assume the cumulative abnormal returns to be normally distributed and test the hypothesis that a DDoS attack announcement has no impact on the victim's stock price. In the latter two methods, we do not assume a distribution and use the empirical distribution of cumulative abnormal returns to test the hypothesis. We find that the assumption of cumulative abnormal returns being normally distributed leads to overestimation/underestimation of the impact. Finally, we analyze the impact of DDoS attack announcement on victim's stock price in each of the 45 cases and present our results."}, {"index": 484, "title": "Neural networks for stock price prediction", "abstract": "Due to the extremely volatile nature of financial markets, it is commonly accepted that stock price prediction is a task full of challenge.

For the purpose of improving the prediction accuracy, we propose a multi-task stock prediction model that not only considers the stock correlations but also supports multi-source data fusion. Our proposed model first utilizes tensor to integrate the multi-sourced data, including financial Web news, investors' sentiments extracted from the social network and some quantitative data on stocks. In this way, the intrinsic relationships among different information sources can be captured, and meanwhile, multi-sourced information can be complemented to solve the data sparsity problem. Secondly, we propose an improved sub-mode coordinate algorithm (SMC). SMC is based on the stock similarity, aiming to reduce the variance of their subspace in each dimension produced by the tensor decomposition. The algorithm is able to improve the quality of the input features, and thus improves the prediction accuracy.

However, they also bring challenges to classic statistic approaches since those models might be constrained to a certain type of data. Aiming at aggregating differently sourced information and offering type-free capability to existing models, a framework for predicting stock market of scenarios with mixed data, including scalar data, compositional data (pie-like) and functional data (curve-like), is established. The presented framework is model-independent, as it serves like an interface to multiple types of data and can be combined with various prediction models. And it is proved to be effective through numerical simulations. Regarding to price prediction, we incorporate the trading volume (scalar data), intraday return series (functional data), and investors' emotions from social media (compositional data) through the framework to competently forecast whether the market goes up or down at opening in the next day. The strong explanatory power of the framework is further demonstrated. Specifically, it is found that the intraday returns impact the following opening prices differently between bearish market and bullish market. And it is not at the beginning of the bearish market but the subsequent period in which the investors' \"fear\" comes to be indicative. The framework would help extend existing prediction models easily to scenarios with multiple types of data and shed light on a more systemic understanding of the stock market."}, {"index": 488, "title": "Effects of a Price limit Change on Market Stability at the Intraday Horizon in the Korean Stock Market", "abstract": "This paper investigates the effects of a price limit change on the volatility of the Korean stock market's (KRX) intraday stock price process.

We then analyze the effects in more detail by applying the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to the data set.

Results obtained from FPCA and Gaussian Kernel PCA seems to be in synergy but with a lag.

Firstly, from the viewpoint of dynamics, we study the existence of the cooling-off effect by following the dynamical evolution of some financial variables over a period of time before the stock price hits its limit. Secondly, from the probability perspective, we investigate, with the logit model, the existence of the cooling-off effect through analyzing the high-frequency data of all A-share common stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2000 to 2011 and inspecting the trading period from the opening phase prior to the moment that the stock price hits its limits. A comparison is made of the properties between up-limit hits and down-limit hits, and the possible difference will also be compared between bullish and bearish market state by dividing the whole period into three alternating bullish periods and three bearish periods. We find that the cooling-off effect emerges for both up-limit hits and down-limit hits, and the cooling-off effect of the down-limit hits is stronger than that of the up-limit hits. The difference of the cooling-off effect between bullish period and bearish period is quite modest. Moreover, we examine the sub-optimal orders effect, and infer that the professional individual investors and institutional investors play a positive role in the cooling-off effects.

To this end, by using a Granger causality analysis in the frequency domain proposed by Lemmens et al.

The empirical results indicate that investor sentiment has a long-term (more than 12 months) or short-term (less than 12 months) predictive effect on stock returns with different firm characteristics. Specifically, the investor sentiment has strong predictability in the stock returns for smaller Size stocks, lower B/M stocks and lower OP stocks, both in the short term and long term, but only has a short-term predictability for higher quantile ones. The investor sentiment merely has predictability for the returns of smaller Inv stocks in the short term, but has a strong short-term and long-term predictability for larger Inv stocks.
